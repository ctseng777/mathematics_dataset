Here\u2019s how to do it:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify Numbers\nFirst, we can round the numbers to make them easier to work with. \n\n- **Round 38785**: We can round this to **39000**. This is close enough for our purposes and makes the division simpler.\n- **Round 41**: We can round this to **40**. This is also a nice round number that is easy to divide by.\n\n### Step 2: Mental Math Steps\nNow we can perform the division with our rounded numbers:\n\n\\[\n39000 \\div 40\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this division, we can break it down:\n\n1. **Divide 39000 by 10**: \n   \\[\n   39000 \\div 10 = 3900\n   \\]\n\n2. **Then divide by 4**: \n   \\[\n   3900 \\div 4\n   \\]\n\nTo divide 3900 by 4, we can think of it as:\n\n- **Divide 3900 by 2** (which is easier):\n  \\[\n  3900 \\div 2 = 1950\n  \\]\n\n- **Then divide 1950 by 2 again**:\n  \\[\n  1950 \\div 2 = 975\n  \\]\n\nSo, \\( 39000 \\div 40 \\approx 975 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning\nNow, we can see that our approximation of \\( 38785 \\div 41 \\) is about **975**. \n\nHowever, since we rounded both numbers up (38785 to 39000 and 41 to 40), our final answer will be slightly higher than the exact value. \n\nTo get a rough estimate, we can round our answer to the nearest...

This is a simple adjustment because -1900 is close to -1857 and makes calculations easier.\n- **Round 36**: We can round this to 40. This is a nice round number that is easy to multiply.\n\n### Step 2: Mental Math Steps\nNow, we multiply the simplified numbers:\n\n- Calculate: \\(-1900 \\times 40\\)\n\nTo do this mentally, we can break it down:\n\n1. First, multiply 1900 by 40:\n   - \\(1900 \\times 40 = 1900 \\times 4 \\times 10\\)\n   - \\(1900 \\times 4 = 7600\\)\n   - Now multiply by 10: \\(7600 \\times 10 = 76000\\)\n\n2.
