Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify Numbers\nFirst, we want to round the numbers to make them easier to work with. \n\n- **Round 91**: We can keep 91 as it is since it\u2019s already a small number.\n- **Round -36338**: We can round this to -36000. This is a nice, round number that is close to -36338 and will make calculations simpler.\n\n### Step 2: Mental Math Steps\nNow, we can perform the mental arithmetic with our rounded numbers:\n\n- Start with 91.\n- Add -36000: \n  \\[\n  91 + (-36000) = 91 - 36000\n  \\]\n- This is the same as subtracting 36000 from 91.

We can think of it as 41000 \u00f7 25.\n  - To make this easier, we can break it down: \n    - 41000 \u00f7 25 is the same as (41000 \u00f7 100) \u00d7 4 = 410 \u00d7 4.\n    - Now, calculate 410 \u00f7 4. \n    - 410 is close to 400, and 400 \u00f7 4 = 100.\n    - Since 410 is slightly more than 400, we can estimate that 410 \u00f7 4 is a bit more than 100, around 102.\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning\nUsing rounding and breaking down the problem into smaller parts makes it easier to handle mentally.

Since we are dividing by a negative number, the result will be negative: **-32**.\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning\nThis approximation strategy is effective because:\n\n- **Rounding**: By rounding to simpler numbers, we reduce the complexity of the calculation, making it easier to perform in our heads.\n- **Estimation**: We focus on the scale of the numbers rather than the exact values, which helps us quickly gauge the result.\n- **Negative Sign**: We remember to apply the negative sign from the divisor, ensuring our final answer reflects the correct sign.\n\nThus, our mental math approximation of 15647 / -544 is roughly **-32**, which is close to the exact answer of -28.76.
