{"input": "Mental math: approximately 17 times -10?", "approximate_answer": "-170", "exact_answer": "-170.0", "lower_bound": "-187.0", "upper_bound": "-153.0", "solution": "To approximate \\( 17 \\times -10 \\) using mental math, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify Numbers\n**Round the numbers for easier calculation.**  \nIn this case, \\( 17 \\) is already a manageable number, but we can keep it as is. The number \\( -10 \\) is also straightforward. So, we can keep both numbers as they are for this problem.\n\n### Step 2: Mental Math Steps\n**Perform the multiplication.**  \nTo multiply \\( 17 \\) by \\( -10 \\), think of it as:\n- First, calculate \\( 17 \\times 10 \\). This is easier because multiplying by 10 just adds a zero:  \n  \\( 17 \\times 10 = 170 \\).\n- Since we are multiplying by \\( -10 \\), we need to make the result negative:  \n  \\( 17 \\times -10 = -170 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning\n**Why this strategy is effective:**  \nRounding numbers simplifies the calculation process, making it easier to perform in your head. By breaking down the multiplication into smaller, manageable parts (like multiplying by 10), you can quickly arrive at the answer without needing a calculator. This method helps you develop number sense and improves your overall mental math skills.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the approximate answer for \\( 17 \\times -10 \\) is \\( -170 \\).
