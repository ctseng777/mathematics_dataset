This is a simpler number that is close to -4026.\n- For 57, we can round it to 60. This is a nearby round number that makes addition easier.\n\n### Step 2: Mental Math Steps\n**Now, perform the mental arithmetic with the rounded numbers.**  \n- Add the rounded numbers:  \n  \\(-4000 + 60\\)  \n  This can be thought of as:  \n  \\(-4000 + 60 = -3940\\).\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning\n**Explain why this approximation strategy is effective.**  \n- Rounding numbers makes calculations quicker and reduces the complexity of mental math. By using -4000 instead of -4026 and 60 instead of 57, we simplify the problem while still staying close to the original numbers. This allows us to get a good estimate without needing to do precise calculations. The actual answer, -3969, is close to our estimate of -3940, showing that our method is effective for quick approximations.\n\n### Conclusion\nUsing rounding and simple addition, we can quickly estimate that -4026 + 57 is approximately -3940.
