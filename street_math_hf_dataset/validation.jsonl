Here\u2019s how to do it:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify Numbers\nFirst, we can round the numbers to make them easier to work with. In this case, we can keep -8 as it is, but we can think of -47 as approximately -50. This rounding helps simplify our calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Mental Math Steps\nNow, we can perform the calculation using our rounded numbers:\n- Start with -8.\n- Subtract 50: \n  \\[\n  -8 - 50 = -58\n  \\]\nHowever, since we rounded -47 down to -50, we need to adjust our answer slightly. \n\n### Step 3: Adjust the Result\nSince we rounded -47 down to -50, we need to add back the difference (which is 3, because -50 is 3 less than -47):\n- Adjusting our result:\n  \\[\n  -58 + 3 = -55\n  \\]\n\n### Reasoning\nThis approximation strategy is effective because rounding makes the numbers easier to handle mentally.

Here\u2019s how to do it:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify Numbers\nFirst, we want to round the numbers to make them easier to work with. \n\n- **Round -42** to **-40** (it's close and easier to multiply).\n- **Round 420** to **400** (again, it's close and simplifies the calculation).\n\n### Step 2: Mental Math Steps\nNow, we can multiply the simplified numbers:\n\n- Multiply -40 by 400:\n  \\[\n  -40 \\times 400 = -16000\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Adjust for Approximation\nSince we rounded both numbers down (from -42 to -40 and from 420 to 400), our result of -16000 is a bit lower than the exact answer. To get a better approximation, we can consider that we rounded down both numbers, which means our approximation is slightly less than the actual product. \n\nTo adjust, we can think about how much we rounded down:\n- The difference from -42 to -40 is 2, and from 420 to 400 is 20. \n\nSo, we can add a bit back to our result:\n- Adding a rough estimate of the impact of the rounding gives us:\n  \\[\n  -16000 + 2000 = -18000\n  \\]\n\n### Reasoning\nThis approximation strategy is effective because rounding numbers to the nearest ten or hundred simplifies multiplication, making it easier to do in your head. By adjusting for the rounding, we can get a more accurate estimate without needing to do the exact calculation. This technique helps in quickly estimating products, especially when dealing with larger numbers. \n\nIn summary, by rounding -42 to -40 and 420 to 400, we simplified our calculation and arrived at a reasonable approximation of -18000.", "difficulty": "train-medium", "module": "street_math__mul"}
