This is close enough for our approximation and makes calculations simpler.\n- **Round 41**: We can round this to 40, which is a nice, round number.\n\n### Step 2: Mental Math Steps\nNow, we can multiply the simplified numbers:\n\n- Multiply -5800 by 40:\n  \n  \\[\n  -5800 \\times 40 = -232000\n  \\]\n\nTo do this mentally, you can break it down further:\n- First, calculate \\( 5800 \\times 40 \\):\n  - \\( 5800 \\times 40 = 5800 \\times (4 \\times 10) = (5800 \\times 4) \\times 10 \\)\n  - \\( 5800 \\times 4 = 23200 \\)\n  - Then multiply by 10: \\( 23200 \\times 10 = 232000 \\)\n- Finally, apply the negative sign: \\( -232000 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning\nThis approximation strategy is effective because rounding makes the numbers easier to handle. By using numbers that are close to the original values, we can quickly estimate the product without getting bogged down in complex calculations. \n\nIn this case, we rounded -5782 to -5800 and 41 to 40, which allowed us to compute the product mentally. The result, -232000, is close to the exact answer of -237062. \n\n### Conclusion\nUsing rounding and breaking down the multiplication into simpler steps helps us quickly arrive at a reasonable estimate.
